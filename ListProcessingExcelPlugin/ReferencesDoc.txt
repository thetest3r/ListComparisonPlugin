This compares what is in sheet 1 and not sheet 2
Im assuming you just need to flip the code to run it against both o_o,

The bolded would be what is different in sheet two


MVP:
An excel plugin that (destructively) compares two lists of items

The current specs are:
	-Destrutive algorithm
	-Items across the range are treated as a single entity (string in this case)
	-Different items from each sheet are bolded (the items will be printed out in a third sheet)
